# 🎨 Logo Setup Instructions

## How to Add Your Logo to Solution Property

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo File
1. Locate your logo file: `a94b00cf-9ff1-4325-9daa-a5ce2b5b811b.jpeg`
2. Make sure it's a high-quality JPEG image
3. Recommended dimensions: 512x512 pixels or larger (square format works best)

### Step 2: Add Logo to Project
1. Copy your JPEG file to the `public` folder in your project
2. Rename it to `logo.jpeg`
3. The final path should be: `public/logo.jpeg`

### Step 3: Verify Logo Integration
Your logo is now integrated in the following places:
- **Header**: Shows in the top navigation bar
- **Empty State**: Displays when no inspections are found
- **PDF Reports**: Will appear in printed/exported reports

### Features Included:
✅ **Responsive Design**: Logo scales appropriately on different screen sizes
✅ **Fallback Protection**: Shows default icon if image fails to load
✅ **Multiple Sizes**: Small, medium, and large variants
✅ **Clean Styling**: Rounded corners and subtle shadow
✅ **Professional Look**: Integrated seamlessly with your brand

### Logo Component Usage:
The Logo component can be used throughout the app with different options:

```tsx
<Logo size="small" />      // Small logo with text
<Logo size="medium" />     // Medium logo with text (default)
<Logo size="large" />      // Large logo with text
<Logo showText={false} />  // Logo only, no text
```

### File Structure:
```
public/
├── logo.jpeg           ← Your logo file goes here
└── ...

src/
├── components/
│   ├── Logo.tsx        ← Reusable logo component
│   └── InspectionApp.tsx
└── ...
```

### Important Notes:
- The logo file MUST be named exactly `logo.jpeg`
- Place it in the `public` folder (not `src`)
- The app will automatically use your logo once the file is added
- If the logo fails to load, it will show a fallback icon

### Ready to Use!
Once you've copied your logo file to `public/logo.jpeg`, refresh your application and you'll see your custom logo throughout the Solution Property interface! 🚀
