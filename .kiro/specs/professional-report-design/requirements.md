# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement focuses on transforming the current report generation system from a basic, cluttered layout to a professional, designer-quality document. The enhancement addresses critical visual design issues including table redesign, margin standardization, hierarchical layout implementation, and comprehensive visual improvements that elevate the report's professional presentation and readability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a property inspector, I want clean and readable grade tables without visual clutter, so that my findings are presented professionally and are easy to interpret.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL replace dense grid lines with subtle horizontal dividers between table rows
2. WHEN displaying grade information THEN the system SHALL apply light background shading (e.g., amber for Grade D) to highlight key data without border overload
3. WHEN formatting table content THEN the system SHALL use bold formatting exclusively in the "Grade" column to create clear visual separation from "Description"
4. WHEN rendering tables THEN the system SHALL eliminate excessive vertical and horizontal lines that create visual clutter

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a report recipient, I want consistent and adequate margins throughout the document, so that the content appears professional and is comfortable to read.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any page THEN the system SHALL implement uniform 1.25-inch padding on all sides
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL ensure no content appears cramped against page edges
3. WHEN formatting pages THEN the system SHALL provide visual breathing space for enhanced readability
4. WHEN creating the document layout THEN the system SHALL establish deliberate, organized document framing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a document reader, I want a clear visual hierarchy and organized layout, so that I can easily navigate and understand the information structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN structuring content THEN the system SHALL establish clear typographic hierarchy through strategic whitespace allocation
2. WHEN organizing sections THEN the system SHALL implement consistent section spacing and logical content grouping
3. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL implement multi-column components to improve information density and create natural reading flow
4. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL highlight key data relationships through layout design

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a professional inspector, I want consistent headers and footers on every page, so that my reports maintain branding and navigation continuity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any page THEN the system SHALL include consistent headers and footers that serve as anchors
2. WHEN displaying headers/footers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent branding and navigation elements including page numbers
3. WHEN creating multi-page documents THEN the system SHALL provide visual continuity throughout the document
4. WHEN formatting pages THEN the system SHALL ensure headers and footers appear identically across all pages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a report creator, I want a structured grid system for findings presentation, so that content is perfectly aligned and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying findings THEN the system SHALL implement a 2/3 column layout for text and 1/3 column for images
2. WHEN arranging content THEN the system SHALL ensure perfect alignment of all elements within the grid system
3. WHEN presenting information THEN the system SHALL create a more dynamic presentation than traditional tables
4. WHEN structuring layout THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent grid proportions throughout the document

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a document reader, I want clear visual hierarchy through typography, so that I can quickly identify and navigate different levels of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting headings THEN the system SHALL use the largest font size for main headings
2. WHEN displaying subheadings THEN the system SHALL use smaller but bold formatting
3. WHEN presenting body text THEN the system SHALL use standard size and weight
4. WHEN creating the document THEN the system SHALL guide reader attention effectively and create logical information flow

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want photos to be treated as primary evidence with proper sizing and positioning, so that visual documentation is immediately connected to findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN including photos THEN the system SHALL size them to occupy approximately one-third of the finding's width
2. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL maintain high resolution for clarity
3. WHEN positioning photos THEN the system SHALL place them adjacent to relevant descriptions
4. WHEN presenting visual evidence THEN the system SHALL eliminate the need for separate appendices by integrating photos directly with findings
5. WHEN displaying images THEN the system SHALL create immediate visual connection between findings and evidence
